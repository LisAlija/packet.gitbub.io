	<transcript sound="sound1"><![CDATA[Some bacteria are able to produce spores, which protect them against adverse conditions such as high temperatures, drying and disinfection. <br /><br />This is a safe resting phase for bacteria until conditions are favourable again for their growth. Bacteria do not multiply at this stage.<br /><br />When the bacterium is destroyed, for example during cooking, the spore, containing a dormant bacterium, survives. This process is called sporulation. Toxins or poisons may also be released during sporulation.<br /><br />When favourable conditions return, the spore releases the bacterium which can then start to grow and multiply and more toxins may be produced. This process is known as germination.]]></transcript>
