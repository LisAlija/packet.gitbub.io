	<transcript sound="sound1"><![CDATA[Cuts, spots and sores are an ideal place for bacterial multiplication. Septic cuts and boils often harbour large numbers of food poisoning organisms.<br /><br />Food handlers with open wounds or skin infections should not handle food or be allowed to work in food rooms.<br /><br />To prevent contamination of food by harmful bacteria and blood, these lesions should be completely covered by waterproof dressings, preferably coloured blue to aid detection if they become detached.<br /><br />Dressings should be replaced immediately if they become loose. Cuts on fingers may need the extra protection of waterproof finger-stalls.<br /><br />Blue, waterproof dressings are an essential part of the first aid box. Antiseptics and pills should not be included.]]></transcript>
